Data Mining course project - COVID-19: Impacts and Insights

*Check out the full report and blog.*

This project consists of three tasks - 

1. Analyzing the efficacy of the non-pharmaceutical interventions
2. Projecting COVID deaths and cases based on Time-Series analysis
3. Effect of COVID on mental health by analysis of survey data

## **Task 1**
This is a reproduction of the results using the Covid19Model by Imperial College London team. Check out their project ![here](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model) and paper !["Estimating the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in Europe"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7), Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al, Nature, 2020. 

## **Task 2**
This task deals with projecting cases and deaths related to COVID using time-series models. To run the models, check out the python notebook *Standard_models_projection.ipynb* for standard models and *LSTM_projection.ipynb* for deep learning based models. Both of them are available under directory Task2.

## **Task 3**
This deals with estimating levels of 'Anxious', 'Down', 'Interest', and 'Worry' based on the Pulse Survey data. To run the models, check out the python notebook *COVID_mental_health.ipynb*. 

### Data
The data for each of the tasks is available under the respective directories.
